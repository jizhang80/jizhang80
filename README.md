Hello! ðŸ‘‹  

I'm a __full-stack engineer__ focus on __MERN__ stack. I'd like to build application base on __Tailwindcss/Next.js/React.js and Express.js/Node.js__ platform.  

I was a software/QA engineer DBA and system engineer for the past 20 years. Specialized in system building, diagnostic and optimization in traditional enterprise IT high-availability environments, Linux/Unix, Server/Storage hardware/software especially Oracle enterprise-level database systems.  

My career finally reached its peak in the IBM mainframe advanced technical support team(2012-2016), and at the same time, with the advent of the cloud era, it also came to an end.  

I hope to continue my career as an IT engineer. Almost all positions currently require programming skills, so in recent years I have revisited the classic content of software engineering, operating systems, algorithms and data structures, Agile and DevOps, etc.  

I will take full-stack engineering as the starting point of my new career, also would like to accumulate experience in building cryptocurrency and AI systems in the future.  

I have completed the Harvard University CS50x, CS50python and CS50web courses and am currently in a full-stack (MERN stack) bootcamp with plans to graduate in February 2024.  

My job role development targets __independent contractors, start-ups and small and medium-sized enterprises__.   

I hope to grow quickly by accumulating __end-to-end practical experience__, and ultimately achieve the goal of quickly delivering customer needs.
